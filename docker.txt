This is The Docker Branch

docker - shows the details about the docker commands and options
docker ps - shows the details about the docker container's state (if running)
docker pull <image-name> - pulls/downloads the specific image from docker.hub to local machine
docker run <image-name> - runs the docker container for the specific image, often uses '-i' flag for interactive, '-t' flag for terminal, 'd' flag for detached mode
docker images - shows the available images locally on the machine
docker stop <container-id/container-name> - stops the docker container
docker start <container-id/container-name> - starts the docker container
docker build -t <image-name> <dockerfile-location> - builds the docker image, '-t' flag for image name

project1 = created project1 named as java-app for image, for running "docker run -it java-app"
docker attach <container-id/container-name> - attach the container terminal to host terminal, useful to observe logs in container

project2 = created project2 named as node-app for image, for runnning "docker run -it node-app"
docker network ls - shows all the available docker networks on the machine
docker network create <network-name> -d <driver-name> - creates a docker network with provided driver (by '-d' flag), (drivers can be [ipvlan,macvlan,none,bridge,overlay,host,user-defined])

project3 = created project3 named as flask-app for image, for running, firstly spin database container by "docker run -d --name <container-name> --network <network-name> -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<mysql-root-password> -e MYSQL_DATABASE=<mysql-database> <image-name>" and then spin server container by "docker run -d -p <host-port>:<container-port> --network <network-name> -e MYSQL_HOST=<mysql-host> -e MYSQL_USER=<mysql-user> -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql-password> -e MYSQL_DB=<mysql-database> <image-name>"
docker volume ls - shows all available volumes onto the machine
docker volume create <volume-name> - creates a docker volume with the provided name
docker run -v <volume-name>:var/lib/mysql <image-name> - while running the database container it will bind the container's database(s) to host's database(s) to persist the data after container lifecycle
COMPOSE.YAML - runs an application in an isolated environment with single non-redundant flow
docker compose up - runs whole compose scripts for application includes whole environment, networks, healthcheck, lifecycle of containers
docker compose down - stops whole compose scripts for application includes whole environment, networks, healthcheck, lifecycle of containers
docker tag <image-name>:latest username/<hub-image-name>:latest - tags a local image for remote hub with provided name
docker push username/<hub-image-name>:latest - pushes the specific local image for remote hub with provided name
