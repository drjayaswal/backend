This is The NGINX Branch

apt update - it updates the machine to install the nginx, mostly Linux via ubuntu
apt-get install nginx - it downloads and installs the nginx onto the machine
cd etc/nginx && vim nginx.conf - navigate to the downloaded nginx's directory and updates the nginx code
nginx -s reload - reloads the nginx server, may requires 'sudo' command for permissions
