This is The NGINX Branch

apt update - it updates the machine to install the nginx, mostly Linux via ubuntu
apt-get install nginx - it downloads and installs the nginx onto the machine
cd etc/nginx && vim nginx.conf - navigate to the downloaded nginx's directory and updates the nginx code
nginx -s reload - reloads the nginx server, may requires 'sudo' command for permissions

nginx.conf :
    events {} - deals with how the server physically handles the network traffic at a low level
        worker_connections - handle 4096 connections per worker
        multi_accept - grab all waiting connections immediately
        use epoll - use the most efficient method for Linux
        example:
            events {
                worker_connections 4096;
                
                multi_accept on;
                
                use epoll;
            }
